/**
two ways to add and implement js in html
Internal Js (add js code in html code by use script tag or
add in head tag but the best is to use at the end of body 
any client side scripting language will add by script tag in
html code)
External Js
make a seperate file for js code and call this file in html
file in head tag like this
<script src="filename"></script>
if the file is too much heavy/lengthy then use at the end
of body tag.
